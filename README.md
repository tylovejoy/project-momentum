# Project Momentum
> An opinionated **Overwatch 2** Doomfist parkour **framework** and editor: precise movement, race-ready checkpoints, and extendable effect volumes.

## Why Project Momentum?
Doomfist parkour has its own physics, flow, and skill ceiling. Project Momentum provides a **clean, modular baseline** for creators who want consistent OW2-only mechanics, a fast authoring loop, and a clear separation between **play template** and **editor tools**.

## Core Ideas
- **OW2 Doomfist only.** No legacy mechanics mixed in.
- **Editor + Play Template.** Build maps quickly, then lock them for race play.
